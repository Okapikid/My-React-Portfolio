              Heya, name's Mike Augustine, but it's Auggie (IRL) & Okapikid
              online. I spend my days as a Strategist at Mojo, an incredible
              consultancy in NYC & Cincinnati, OH. If you're a brand in need of
              anything from brand identity to PR to strategy to designâ€”hit us
              up. I'm obsessed with experiential design, gaming in every shape
              and form, and inconsequential bets.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you've got a problem, I want to solve it.
              <br />
              <br />
              If it's not a game, let's make it one.
              <br />
              <br />
              (But also, it's definitely a game.)
